UI Animation Node Graph based on DOTween. <br>
Pretty crude and has only like four types of animation. I just made it to use myself.

Put into the Plugins folder.
DOTween is required for it to work.

To use attach a UI Animaion component to an object. There will be settings to set up some thing.
<br>
To open the graph use "Tools/Lifty/UI Animation Graph" and the drag the component from the object or select it in the graph and open it.
